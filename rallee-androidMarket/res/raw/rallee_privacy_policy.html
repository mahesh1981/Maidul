		<strong>3. OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Except as provided below, Rallee will not sell, rent, trade or
		otherwise transfer any personal and/or traffic data or communications
		content without your explicit permission, unless it is obliged to do
		so under applicable laws or by order of the competent authorities.
		Please note that information that you voluntarily make public in your
		user profile, or which you disclose on forums, discussions boards or
		by posting comments will be publicly available and viewable by others.</p>
	<p>Rallee may disclose personal information to respond to legal
		requirements, exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
		claims, to protect Rallee’s interests, fight against fraud and to
		enforce our policies or to protect anyone&#8217;s rights, property, or
		safety.</p>
	<p>Some Rallee products may be co-branded and offered together with
		or via a partner company. If you register for or use such products,
		you consent to both Rallee and the partner company’s use of personal
		data collected in connection with the co-branded product. Rallee may
		offer its products in connection with other websites or services or
		may team with other online services to give you the combined results
		of both products/services or additional services and benefits. To
		determine whether you would benefit from the combined offer, if you
		have provided your consent, Rallee may match your email address, and
		email addresses of your contacts against email addresses you have
		provided to the third party website/service provider.</p>
	<p>If you leave a voicemail for another Rallee user, your voicemail
		message may be transferred to a third party service provider (where
		the Rallee contact you are trying to reach has signed up to receive
		voicemails by text message), and will be converted to text. The
		conversion process may in exceptional cases, require access by
		analysts. By using the voicemail product, you consent to the
		processing of your voicemail message by Rallee and its service
		provider.</p>
	<p>
		Rallee reserves the right to transfer information outside of your
		country. By using Rallee software, Rallee&#8217;s websites or Rallee
		products you consent to any such transfer of information outside of
		your country. Rallee abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and
		the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S.
		Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
		data from the European Economic Area, and Switzerland. To learn more
		about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please

	</p>
	<p>In any transactions in which Rallee or substantially all of its
		assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of Rallee
		users will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We
		reserve the right to include your personal information in any such
		transfer to a third party.</p>

		time, either by changing your browser settings (if your browser
		permits) or by ceasing to use Rallee’s websites and/or software or by
		using the applicable opt-out functions. You should be aware that
		certain features are only available through the use of cookies and if
		you choose not to accept cookies, such features may not be available
		to you.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>4.1 What are Cookies and GIFs?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>4.1.1. Cookies</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Cookies are small files containing a string of characters (text)
		that are sent to your browser from a website’s server. The cookie may
		contain a unique identifier but it does not contain personally
		identifiable information such as your name or email address. Rallee
		may use cookies when you visit its websites, or use Rallee’s software.
		The browser of the Rallee software client or your Internet browser

		accessed by the website during your next visit. Other websites may
		also send cookies to your browser but your browser will not allow

	</p>
	<p>Rallee web pages and client interfaces may include clear gifs,
		also known as web-beacons and tracking pixels. Gifs are tiny graphics
		with a unique identifier, which are used to count your visits to the
		page (but which do not retain any personally identifiable
		information). In addition, Rallee uses clear gifs in our HTML-based
		emails to let us know which emails have been opened and acted upon.
		This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications
		and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns</p>
	<p>

		search engines and keywords used to find our sites, links accessed
		from our sites, error and crash information about our clients, and
		similar information. These analytics are not used to track your
		journey to other websites or to identify you.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>4.4.2. Affiliates</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Rallee’s affiliate network program partner allows third parties
		to introduce people to Rallee. Our affiliates may send cookies to your
		computer to allow them to receive information (a) when you click on a
		Rallee related link on one of our affiliate partner sites, and/or (b)
		when you make a purchase in Rallee’s software, for the purpose of
		paying commission to the affiliate partner. If you re-visit Rallee’s
		site directly, our affiliate network program partner can recognize you
		and reward the third-party affiliate partner site that referred you to
		our site. These cookies are not within Rallee’s control.</p>

		traffic data can only be accessed by authorized employees of Rallee or
		service providers who need to have access to this data in order to be
